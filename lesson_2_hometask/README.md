# Task #1: 
- ## Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'. 

> ### 1. Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
> ### 2. Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

# Task #2: 
- ## Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 1, and write an if-else chain.

> ## 1. If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
> ## 2. If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
> ## 3. Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.


# Task #3:

- ## Alien Colors #3: Turn your if-else chain from Exercise 2 into an if-elif-else chain.

> ## 1. If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
> ## 2. If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
> ## 3. If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
> ## 4. Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the appropriate color alien.


# Task #4:

- ## Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person’s stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:

> ## 1. If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
> ## 2. If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
> ## 3. If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
> ## 4. If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
> ## 5. If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.
> ## 6. If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.
